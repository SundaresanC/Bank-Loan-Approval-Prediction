# Bank Loan Prediction using Random Forest and SVM

This project predicts the approval of bank loans based on various applicant data using two machine learning algorithms: **Random Forest** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**. The model is trained on a dataset of loan applications and aims to predict whether a loan will be approved or not based on factors like income, credit score, and other financial details.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can classify loan approval statuses into two categories: **Approved** and **Rejected**. By training the model with various features such as applicant’s credit score, income, and other relevant factors, we aim to assist banks in making data-driven decisions regarding loan applications.

## Algorithms Used

1. **Random Forest Classifier**: An ensemble learning method that works by creating multiple decision trees and combining their outputs for a more accurate and stable prediction.
   
2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A supervised learning algorithm that works by finding a hyperplane that best separates data into different classes, used here for classifying loan approvals.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about loan applicants and their application statuses. Key features include:
- Applicant’s credit score
- Income
- Employment status
- Loan amount
- Previous loan history
- Other financial indicators

The dataset is pre-processed by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features to improve the model performance.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bank-loan-prediction.git
